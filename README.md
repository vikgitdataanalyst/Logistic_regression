# Logistic_regression
Hey!
This project demonstrates the implementation of Logistic Regression, a machine learning algorithm used for binary classification. The dataset is preprocessed, including handling missing values, dropping unnecessary columns, splitting the data, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

Features....
Data Preprocessing: Dropping irrelevant columns and replacing missing values.
Data Splitting: Dividing data into training and testing sets.
Logistic Regression Model: Training and fitting the model using Scikit-learn.
Predictions: Making predictions on test data.
Model Evaluation: Calculating accuracy and analyzing predicted results.
Data Preprocessing Steps
Load the Dataset: Import data from a structured file (CSV, Excel, etc.).
Drop Unnecessary Columns: Remove columns that do not contribute to prediction.
Replace Missing Values: Fill or drop missing values to ensure clean data.
Split Data: Divide data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.


Model Training & Evaluation:

Train Logistic Regression Model: Fit the model to the training data.
Make Predictions: Generate predictions on the test set.
Calculate Accuracy Score: Measure how well the model performs.
Analyze Predicted Data: Compare actual vs. predicted values using a confusion matrix and classification report.
